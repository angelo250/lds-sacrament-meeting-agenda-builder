# LDS Sacrament Meeting Agenda builder 
This project uses [Google's App Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script) to create a new sacrament meeting agenda Google doc.

## How it works
The sacrament meeting agenda builder works by pulling data like sacrament meeting speakers, topics and music from a Google Sheet, and creating a new Google doc based on a given template.  

## Permissions
This solution requires that you grant read, create and edit permission on Google Sheets and Google Docs to Google App Script Engine.
